Regulations 
<h2>Hogwarts Grounds
Students shall not leave Hogwarts grounds.
Students may leave with the Headmaster's permission, if collected by a parent or guardian.
On the first and third weekends of each month, Third through Seventh Years may visit Hogsmeade Village with a permission slip from the student's parent or guardian. Students are free to travel to Hogsmeade after classes on Friday (3:00 pm) until curfew (10:00 pm), when they are expected to be back in their dorms at Hogwarts. On Saturday and Sunday they may from after breakfast (8:00 am) until curfew (10:00 pm) on the same day.
Visitors to Hogwarts must obtain permission from the Headmaster or Deputy Headmaster. This includes parents of students, and Ministry personnel.
The only exceptions to this rule are members of the Hogwarts Board of Governors, who have free access to the school.
Faculty Areas
Students are forbidden from faculty areas. This includes the kitchen, faculty lounge, and offices, unless with the escort or written permission of a faculty member. This also includes classrooms when a class is not in session. (Note that class scenes don't necessarily have to be run by staff. There is plenty of opportunity in classes for RP that doesn't involve someone actively playing a professor. Feel free to pose professors in the background for class scenes.)
Prefects may enter faculty areas if investigating another student violating this rule.
House Areas
Access to common rooms and dormitories is strictly controlled.
Students may not enter the common rooms or dormitories of houses other than their own. Each common room has a protective measure in place to restrict access. The Gryffindor Tower and Slytherin Dungeon require passwords. Ravenclaw Tower requires the answer to a riddle. The Hufflepuff Basement requires tapping a specific barrel in a particular rhythm. Attempts to bypass these protective measures by members of other houses are considered serious offences.
Boys may not enter the girls' dormitories. Attempts to do so will trigger spells preventing it, such as a Slide Spell on the staircases in the Gryffindor and Ravenclaw rooms. The one exception to this is a male Prefect in an emergency.
Curfew
Students must be in their dormitories and in bed by a 10:00 p.m. curfew.
Students may not leave their house common rooms until 6:00 a.m.
Prefects may be out of bed after hours if they are scheduled for patrol duty. Prefects must still remain within the castle during patrols.
The Forbidden Forest
The Forbidden Forest (a.k.a. the Dark Forest) is expressly forbidden to students without a faculty escort. As of the 1938-39 term, students are forbidden from even approaching the forest, due to the increased danger of the centaur clan conflicts.
OOC: Do not enter the Forbidden Forest without staff supervision. If you want a scene in the forest, put in a +request (and understand that there is a very good chance that your character will not survive).
The Black Lake
Swimming in the Black Lake is prohibited without faculty or Prefect supervision.
Boating on the lake is prohibited without faculty permission.
Though the juvenile Giant Squid is friendly, other inhabitants of the lake (such as Grindylows and Selkies), and the cold itself, can be dangerous.
Restricted Section of the Library
This area is roped off and forbidden to students, unless they present a signed note from a professor.
Some notes will be for a specific book, some are for a specific subject. But students are never given free access to every book in the Restricted Section.
Books from the Restricted Section may not be removed from the Restricted Section. Books must be taken to one of the desks provided in the section.
Conduct
Uniform
Students shall be in uniform at all times while on Hogwarts grounds. This includes robes, jumper, shirt, tie, slacks/skirt, shoes (Mary Janes for girls, dress shoes for boys) and socks, and gloves and scarf when necessary. All articles must be kept neat and tidy (i.e. shirt tucked in, tie worn properly, shoes polished, clothing washed and without excessive wrinkles).
Pointed hats are also part of the uniform, but are ceremonial in nature, and not required except at special assemblies (e.g. the Start-of-Term and End-of-Term Feasts).
Robes (but not the rest of the uniform) may be removed when not in class or at assemblies (e.g. meals, after classes, weekends, etc.).
Additions to the uniform are unacceptable without special permission. Reasonable hair adornments, eyewear, and small jewelry (i.e. rings, necklaces, earrings) are exempt from this. Excessive jewelry may be confiscated by faculty.
Students may dress casually during Hogsmeade weekends, if they have permission to visit Hogsmeade.
Magic
Magic should only be used by students in relation to school work, or approved extracurricular activities.
Students may cast spells appropriate to their studies in classrooms and other study areas. Study areas include common rooms, and the Great Hall (when not being used for meals).
Magic that is not related to studies may only be cast with the permission and supervision of a faculty member, Prefect, or Head Boy/Girl.
Duelling may only be performed on the duelling stage (in the club room), under the direct supervision of a faculty member or Prefect.
Students always have the right to use magic to defend themselves, or to respond to an emergency.
Attendance
Students must attend all classes, meals, and assemblies that they are scheduled for.
Only written or verbal permission from Madam Spleen or a Professor can excuse absenteeism.
Hogwarts is a boarding school full of eyes (students, faculty, ghosts, Peeves, paintings, etc.), making it just about impossible to get away with playing hooky. If you skip classes, you will be caught and disciplined. Discipline consists, at the very least, of loss of house points and detention.
The requirement on attending all meals is rather loosely enforced. The faculty is understanding, but also knows that skipped meals are a great time for students to be up to no good. Head counts are taken at every meal, and a student that shows a pattern of frequent absence will be warned, and eventually disciplined.
Decorum and Behaviour
Students shall maintain decorum and good behaviour at all times.
Swearing, snogging, shouting in the halls, vandalism, fighting, provoking Peeves, and releasing puffskeins in Mr. Pringle's office during mating season are strictly forbidden.
During breakfast and dinner meals, all students are required to remain at their house tables for the duration of the meal. During lunchtime meals, this rule is less strictly enforced, and will only take effect if problems arise.
Alcohol and Tobacco
Alcohol and tobacco are strictly prohibited on Hogwarts grounds. Butterbeer may be consumed in Hogsmeade, but may not be brought back to the school.</h2>
